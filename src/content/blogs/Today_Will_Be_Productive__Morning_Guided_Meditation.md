# Stop Scrolling. Start Doing: Your 10-Minute Guide to a Productive Morning

Do you typically wake up and reach for your phone in a manic frenzy before spending the rest of the morning scrolling through it, feeling dizzy and off-balance before the day has even begun?

You are not alone. Nothing will derail focus and productivity more quickly than that rush of early-morning stress, in which your to-do list appears to have increased twofold before breakfast. We tend to leap into action without first getting our feet on the ground.

How would it be to reverse the script and become more relaxed in focus and less struggle-like when work is more like a flow?

Your necessary reset button is the very strong 10-minute audio above, to this day, called—**Today Will Be Productive: Morning Guided Meditation.**—It is meant to be the first thing that you do when you first wake up, before reviewing email, news, or social media.

Press play now to bring golden, rejuvenating energy into your day and set an intention for peace and high performance.

## The 10-Minute Productivity Hack: Why Morning Meditation Works

An effective day does not mean getting in a hurry; an effective day is one that takes its place as a point of balance and purpose. The method presented in this particular morning meditation is an effective method of changing the state of your mind to one of alertness and concentration.

Your brain, when you get up, is very flexible. Mindfulness is the process of clearing the mental fog and providing neural pathways to clarity, creativity, and flow state by performing mindfulness.

This session incorporates two key components:

1.  **Golden Sunlight Visualization:** This exercise involves visualizing the sunlight as you bathe your whole body using visualized sunlight. This method brings all cells to life, and you will not be in a deep sleep anymore, but the feelings of natural rejuvenation and preparedness.
2.  **Energizing Breathwork:** This practice takes you through a process of shifting between soft and gentle breaths to deep, deliberate breathing (with a strong clench-and-sigh release). This is an indication to your body that it is time to move on, not to rest and go to sleep.

Studies indicate that meditation and purposeful breathing lower cortisol (stress hormone) and increase the activity in the prefrontal cortex- the section of the brain that helps in concentration and decision making.

## When to Use This Practice (And Who It’s For)

This guided meditation is ideal when one has problems with procrastination, being constantly distracted, or having the sense that he/she have too much to do. It acts as a practice for success.

You do not allow what is worrying you to take control of your attention; you take power over your attention.

### The Essential Morning Routine

The optimal time of listening to this audio is when you are not going to do anything in your day. Imagine that it is your underlayer.

The following three points will give the greatest payoffs to this practice:

*   **The Moment You Sit Up:** When you are just getting out of bed, sit somewhere in the bed or a comfortable chair, and listen. This traps your brain in its most receptive form, and it is programmed to be productive.
*   **Before Your High-Value Task:** This session might serve to clear your mind so you can move on to the creative opportunities necessary to effectively solve a problem, especially if your day has one critical project (you write a report, have a difficult conversation, do some really useful work).
*   **The Weekend Reset:** Don't spend your days in the office and your nights on productivity. This meditation can be applied on Saturdays and Sundays so that you spend your free time purposefully and restfully, but not as someone who spends a lot of time in their mind.

## Getting the Most Out of This Session

Although it is an entry-level practice, a handful of setup tricks will ensure you derive maximum returns and enter a higher level of flow.

Here are the steps to follow before pressing the play button:

*   **Find Your Spot:** This is where you sit somewhere safely and with comfort and take 10 minutes to yourself. You should use headphones in case you want to immerse yourself in guidance and music.
*   **Establish Alignment:** Bring your back into a straight and comfortable position. Roll your shoulders slightly inwards to open up your chest - this will help open up the chest and flow of energy.
*   **Hand Position:** Have your palms resting in your lap and facing upwards. It is a little appreciation of your body that you are open and you are ready to receive the positive, energized intentions of the day.
*   **Soft Focus:** When you are ready, then close your eyes softly. In case the thoughts do creep onto the scene (they will!), mindfully shift back to your breath or the relaxing music, without criticism. It is this returning that develops your focus muscle.
